Stack-based sound synthesis language

This is an interpreter for a stack-based single-byte-command esoteric language used for sound synthesis. Compile with `gcc main.c -lm -funsigned-char`, use with `./a.out <track_file> | aplay`. Included is the nokia jingle (which I also use as my ringtone), program described in more detail on [my website](https://avethenoul.neocities.org/synth)
